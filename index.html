    <h2>App introduction</h2>

     <h4>I. The general of the App</h4>
     <h5>1. Person who write this app </h5>
     <p>I am Nguyen Anh Tuan CEO from TNGC company, Vietnam. TNGC is the Architect and Engineering design company. In my company, we are design for multi client around the world with many languages like English, Chinese, Vietnam, Korea, Japan... Actuatlly, not many of company staff can speak, write or understand the language which they provide serviec to client. Normally they use free Google Translate for translate the words which my staff wants to translate to. There are two reason that Google translate is not reliable. The first is we translate normally for technical meaning, mostly the translated words is true but in some cases, the translation meaning is not suitable in technical manner. The second is they swith from Google translate to Autocad and vice versa, that takes a lot of time and the concentration, and at last the true of words tranlation sometime they donot understand but they copy it into the Autocad drawing, then the meaning will be different. From that, I want company must change the way of work</p>
