    <h1>Garmin Multi Translation Language!</h1>

    <h2>App introduction</h2>

     <h4>I. The general of the App</h4>
    
     <h4><i>1. Person who write this app </i></h4>
     <p>I am Nguyen Anh Tuan CEO from TNGC company, Vietnam. TNGC is the Architect and Engineering design company. In my company, we are design for multi client around the world with many languages like English, Chinese, Vietnam, Korea, Japan... Actuatlly, not many of company staff can speak, write or understand the language which they provide serviec to client. Normally they use free Google Translate for translate the words which my staff wants to translate to. There are two reason that Google translate is not reliable. The first is we translate normally for technical meaning, mostly the translated words is true but in some cases, the translation meaning is not suitable in technical manner. The second is they swith from Google translate to Autocad and vice versa, that takes a lot of time and the concentration, and at last the true of words tranlation sometime they donot understand but they copy it into the Autocad drawing, then the meaning will be different. From that, I want company must change the way of work</p>
    <h4><i>2. Why it is named Garmin Translation App </i></h4>
    <p>I like Garmin watch with multi sport assistance like running, swimming, gym, bike, golf... and all those function to support people so well in their sport. I name the project is Garmin with the hope it will become multi-language translation base on our translator and google translation. Even though, the app doesn't show out the Garmin but the dll file and coding file is name Garmin </p>
    
    <h4><i>3. The purpose of the App </i></h4>
    <p>As said in the above, the app will translate language inside the Autocad Drawing, may be from Vietnam to Chinese, or from Vietnam to English, or from Vietnam to other language and vice versa. Actually, it will remove Architect and Engineer's work a lot from translation, they can use their mother language and make the translation by the Garmin Translation App. At the moment, the App focus in English language, Chinese and Vietnam language. I will show here some Image of App as following:  </p>

    <p>The program runs inside Autocad to assist of transtaltion to Architect and Engineer</p>
    
    <h4>II. The main function of the App</h4>
    <h4><i>1. The coding of program </i></h4>
     <p>Because it is designed for running inside Autocad then it needs to following instruction and obligation to Autodesk. The app was programed by C# and API supported for Autocad. Beside the app uses the data by Google Sheet then it use some API for Google Sheet. It is also used the Cloud Translation API for helping translation between language. </p>
    <h4><i>2. The registration of the app </i></h4>
    <p>The Garmin translation app run inside the company then it isn't need to register or installation. Company will copy all the app's file to staff computer then load it into Autocad. For the 1st time of running, the app will get the MAC address and saved it inside the Google Sheet. The Administrator will accept for the user by manually if the app used inside and by company computer. That means the computer which isn't accepted by Administrator will not be running </p>
      <h4><i>3. The app interface and function </i></h4>
    <p>The app is simple for using, and it have only one form to imput the data. You can see the Window form interface here</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/TerryTuan/Garmin/blob/main/App%20Image.jpg?raw=true" alt="The App run in Autocad 2022"/>
    <p>When you running the app, you must use the command netload "garmin.dll" for loading app run in autocad. After you loaded the file, you will have command "GT1" command  </p>
    <p>There are left 3 ComboBox, in this combo-box there are 3 languages English, Chinese and Vietnam. When you call command GT1 in Autocad, it will show the window form with the choosen text appear in TexBox top. Then you can choose the language which you want to translate to like Chinese or English. You can see the tranlated image below </p>
