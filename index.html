    <h1>Garmin Multi Translation Language!</h1>

    <h2>App introduction</h2>

     <h4>I. The general of the App</h4>
    
     <h4><i>1. Person who write this app </i></h4>
     <p>I am Nguyen Anh Tuan CEO from TNGC company, Vietnam. TNGC is the Architect and Engineering design company. In my company, we are design for multi client around the world with many languages like English, Chinese, Vietnam, Korea, Japan... Actuatlly, not many of company staff can speak, write or understand the language which they provide serviec to client. Normally they use free Google Translate for translate the words which my staff wants to translate to. There are two reason that Google translate is not reliable. The first is we translate normally for technical meaning, mostly the translated words is true but in some cases, the translation meaning is not suitable in technical manner. The second is they swith from Google translate to Autocad and vice versa, that takes a lot of time and the concentration, and at last the true of words tranlation sometime they donot understand but they copy it into the Autocad drawing, then the meaning will be different. From that, I want company must change the way of work</p>
    <h4><i>2. Why it is named Garmin Translation App </i></h4>
    <p>I like Garmin watch with multi sport assistance like running, swimming, gym, bike, golf... and all those function to support people so well in their sport. I name the project is Garmin with the hope it will become multi-language translation base on our translator and google translation. Even though, the app doesn't show out the Garmin but the dll file and coding file is name Garmin </p>
    
    <h4><i>3. The purpose of the App </i></h4>
    <p>As said in the above, the app will translate language inside the Autocad Drawing, may be from Vietnam to Chinese, or from Vietnam to English, or from Vietnam to other language and vice versa. Actually, it will remove Architect and Engineer's work a lot from translation, they can use their mother language and make the translation by the Garmin Translation App. At the moment, the App focus in English language, Chinese and Vietnam language. I will show here some Image of App as following:  </p>
